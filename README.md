# api

Check this page https://my-json-server.typicode.com/typicode/demo

Here you will find two api’s one for posts and comments 

https://my-json-server.typicode.com/typicode/demo/posts

https://my-json-server.typicode.com/typicode/demo/comments

What you need to do is write a code which will read data from both these api’s and assign comment to its respective post and finally return an object (dict/json) which has the combined data of both posts/comments.
